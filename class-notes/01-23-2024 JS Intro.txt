JavaScript is a programming language.

Computer: 

	-machine
	-simple and complex computing
	-runs programs
	-stores data (information)

hardwares + softwares 
keyboard 	OS - Windows and MacOS, IOS, Android
mouse 		Microsoft Suite
screen 		Sublime
hard-disk   Google, Safari
CPU 		Amazon, Costco, Etsy, Instagram

CPU: Central Processing Unit (Brain of the computer)
Hardware: all the visible pieces of the computer
Software: application that runs on the computer and written with programming languages


input -> ones and zeros - output 
input -> process -> output





Counting system
Decimal - base-10 system

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Binary system - base-2 -> ones and zeros
0 1

Human 			Binary 
0 				00000000
1 				00000001
2 				00000010
3 				00000011
4 				00000100
5 				00000101
6 				00000110
65 				01000001
35 				00100011


10101011 		-> 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 + 1 -> 171

0 - OFF
1 - ON

Bit - one or zero
byte - 8 bits


A
Hello world!


CAT -> 
C 67 		01000011
A 65 		01000001
T 84 		01010100

01000011-01000001-01010100

C T  -> 01000011-00100000-01010100
CT 	 -> 01000011-01010100



'Hello' === 'Hello '
'Hello' === 'hello'


Natural languages 
We were having orientation!


Programming language
50-100 keywords
var, let, const, class, static, final

Syntax: grammar rules of the programming languages

console.log("TechGlobal");


ES6 or ES2015 -> Release happened with JS in 2015 
EcmaScript = JavaScript

JS is an interpreted languague: infer-predict
There are also compiled languages: Java, C#, C++



1. Get the language runtime environment - Node.js
2. The best IDE to write and execute the code
	Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse IDE, Sublime, Atom

IDE: Integrated Development Environment

EXECUTE: run 
COMPILE: syntax error




Syntax Rules: You MUST follow 
Conventions: Not MUST but followed by almost all the programmer. Good to follow



Statement: each line of code
Convention: Each statement is followed by semi-colon (;)


Multi-line typing-editing
Mac: press option and select all the lines/edit/ESC 
Windows: press alt and select all the lines/edit/ESC 

Command = CTRL 
Option = Alt 


How to duplicate a statement to next or previous line 
Mac: Option + Shift + up or down arrow
Windows: Alt + Shift + up or down arrow
