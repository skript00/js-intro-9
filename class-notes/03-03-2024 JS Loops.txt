1. for loop: i as an index or counter 

SYNTAX:

for(initialization; termination_condition; update) {
    // block
}


ITERATION: Each time your loop executes 
INFINITE LOOP: This is a loop having a logical mistake and does not stop 


2. while loop 

SYNTAX: 

while(condition) {
    // block
}


3. do-while 
-while loop checks the condition and if it is true, it executes the code
-do-while loop exetuces the code block first, then checks the condition 
-Because of the difference above, do-while will execute the code-block at least once all the time 

SYNTAX:
do {
    // block 
} while(condition);
